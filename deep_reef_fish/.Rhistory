Data Notes:
1. The transect length for the conductor at platform A is 18.9 meter, Holly 14.5 meter. All transect width is 2 meter.
2. Surveys at two platforms were done in two different years.
3. To compared between platforms, we only pick the surveys occurring in the same months (6,7,8,9,10)
4. To compared the fish density on the crossbeam, we used only the "ME" crossbeams because the lenghts are more close to the lengths of the conductor array.
5. Density is calculated in 10000 squared meters
6. Because data were not normaly distributed, so we use Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test

- Testing if there is difference among conductor,crossbeam and open water at platform A.  Result: both conductor and cross beam had greater amount of overall fish than the open water. There was no difference between cross beam and the conductor.

- Testing if there is difference among conductor,crossbeam and open water at platform HOLLY. Result: both conductor and cross beam had greater amount of overall fish than the open water. There was no difference between cross beam and the conductor.
