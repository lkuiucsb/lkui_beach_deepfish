Data Notes:
1. The transect length for the conductor at platform A is 18.9 meter, Holly 14.5 meter. All transect width is 2 meter.
2. Surveys at two platforms were done in two different years.
3. To compared between platforms, we only pick the surveys occurring in the same months (6,7,8,9,10)
4. To compared the fish density on the crossbeam, we used only the "ME" crossbeams because the lenghts are more close to the lengths of the conductor array.
5. Density is calculated in 10000 squared meters
6. Because data were not normaly distributed, so we use Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test
